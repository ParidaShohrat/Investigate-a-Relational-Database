# Sakila DVD Rental database
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. The DVD rental database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. The DVD rental database has many objects including:

15 tables,
1 trigger,
7 views,
8 functions,
1 domain,
13 sequences

# Project Objective
For this project, I used **PostgreSQL** to query the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as:

What categories of movies are families watching?
What is the difference in the rental duration of family movies in four quartiles?
What is the difference in rental numbers in the two stores?
Who were the top 10 paying customers?

# Project Components  
1. Having **4** questions of interets; 
2. Using supporting **SQL** queries to answer the questions; 
3. Using **Excel Charts** to visualize the final data;
