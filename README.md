# Project Objective
For this project, I used **PostgreSQL** to query the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as:

1. what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups?
2. How they compare on payment earnings?
3. How the stores compare in their performance? 

# Project Components  
1. Having **4** questions of interets; 
2. Using supporting **SQL** queries to answer the questions; 
3. Using **Excel Charts** to visualize the final data;
