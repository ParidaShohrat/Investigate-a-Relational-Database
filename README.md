# Sakila DVD Rental database
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I used **PostgreSQL** to query the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as:

what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups?
How they compare on payment earnings?
How the stores compare in their performance? 

# Project Components  
1. Having 4 questions of interets; 
2. Using supporting **SQL** queries to answer the questions; 
3. Using **Excel** to visualize the final data;
